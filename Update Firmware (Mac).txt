Instructions used are here: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/WiFiShieldFirmwareUpgrading
and here: http://www.uriahbaalke.com/?p=106

If you mix and match both, and mess around with the shield, it'll work eventually.

The final command I ended up running was:
sudo bash ArduinoWifiShield_upgrade_mac.sh -a /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/ -f all
