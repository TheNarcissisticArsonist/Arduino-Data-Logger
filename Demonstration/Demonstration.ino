 * Craig gave me a great explanation for this. Basically, there's a slope that compares
 * some voltage value to a value on the sensor (in this case, ppb). However, no two
 * sensors are the same, and this leads to some problems. Due to their idiosyncrasies,
 * each sensor is slightly offset from that comparison slope by a changing number. This
 * value is grabbed from Ã¼ber-filtered air guarunteed to have none of whatever is being
 * sensed (VOCs), and then subtracted from further readings to remove the offset and
 * facilitate converting a 10 bit integer to a useable value.
 *
 * TLDR: We need to find what the actual zero value on the sensor is and base our
 * conversions off of that.
